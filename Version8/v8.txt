Version 8
11/25/2022
(THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE FINAL VERSION)
- Added logo
- Reworked visuals to be more presentable
- Added a gradient background
- Added a yellow tileset background for the Display
- Changed positions of add/subtract proton/electron buttons slightly
- Managed Global Game Settings included with GMS for general application information
- Added the screenshot button
  - The screenshot button is at the bottom right of the screen
  - Clicking it will save a screenshot to a file location on the user's computer
  - Will display a message to the user about where the screenshot is saved (usually within the AppData/Local folder)
  - Filenames include name of element and the charge
  - Duplicate filenames will overwrite, but this is not an issue as there would therefore be no input change except for the orbit button (which is only visual decoration)
  - This concludes the last of the major functional requirements
- Unless texture changes or other additions are wanted, this will be the version submitted on Wednesday, 11/30/2022
