Version 7
11/13/2022
- Finished the isotope database
- Fixed placements of electrons on Bohr model to be paired up
- Added fixes for electron configuration exceptions, updated Lewis model, Bohr model, and display accordingly
  - With that fix, the Lewis model is now functionally 100% complete unless we find improvements we can make
- Added columns to the database for atomic radii, state of matter at room temperature, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity
- Added parts to the display to show the above information
- Added the "TNR12" font, which is the same as the default "TNR16" font, but smaller
- With the TNR12 font, added code to the display so that isotope information and electron configuration do not overlap with the Bohr model or periodic table inputs
  - For elements 113 and beyond, the electron configuration is still long enough that it just barely touches the electrons if the orbit button is turned on, this is not
    really a problem, and probably doesn't need to be changed, but the fact is still there and we may fix it anyways for the sake of completion
  - This fix has completed the Bohr model requirements, and it is now functionally 100% complete unless we find improvements
- Added the ionization database
  - The ionization energy changes depending on how many fewer electrons the atom has than protons, numerous values for the ionization energies of most of the elements
    at particular charges are known and documented, the ionization database represents these values
  - The column in the main database represents the ionization energy in its neutral charge, the ionization database documents all known further values at various charges
  - The ionization database was fully filled out with this update, and is complete, unlike the isotope database which took another update to finish
  - The ionization database information is shown in the display, replacing the standard ionization energy level when an ion of an applicable charge is detected
- Moved display over a few pixels to allow for more room
- Moved proton and electron add and subtract buttons over that same amount to line up with display's new position
- Added code to account for isotope exceptions to electron affinities
  - Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and iodine have different known electron affinities for a few of their isotopes
  - Added code to account for these and place these values in the display
  - These values are drawn in the new TNR12 font
  - This final bit of programming completed all the requirements for the display, and it is also functionally 100% complete unless we find improvements
- Current state of project: entirely functionally complete except for screenshot system. After that is implemented, fix textures. After that, project complete.
