- Added a red highlight around the cells of the periodic table when the mouse hovers over them
- Changed comments in code according to information obtained from recent meeting with Chris Harmon
- Replaced placeholder text in top left with official display text to represent proton and electron counts, electron configurations, and average atomic mass
- Moved the proton and electron add/subtract buttons to top left of screen near display
- Added the isotope database
  - The isotope database consists of encoded information about each of the known stable isotopes for each element
  - The isotope database is separate from the main database
  - Information in the isotope database is encoded for the sake of easily typing the information, it is automatically decoded in the draw event of the Nucleus object
  - Data added for the first ten elements, the rest will be added at a later date due to the sheer amount of data to include
  - Special case specifically programmed for Hydrogen's isotopes, named Deuterium and Tritium
  - Isotope database information is decoded and drawn on the left of the screen with the rest of the display
