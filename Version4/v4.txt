Version 4
10/13/2022
- all default names for sprite and room resources have been replaced
- some placeholder "Drag & Drop" actions in the draw event for the nucleus have been replaced with proper GML code
- added visually orbiting electrons around the Bohr model, thus completing one of the more complicated features of the project plan
    - added code in the nucleus object that creates seven paths
    - added an object that generates points within those seven paths, required the creation of a script and a timeline, and a second timeline only referenced in code
    - added an object that assumes one of the seven paths and moves along it
    - added code to properly space those electron objects evenly throughout the paths
    - added code to all input methods that makes it so that electrons don't appear on screen unless the nucleus ecount is appropriate
    - overall generation of paths and creation of electron objects takes about a second of real time, plans for a short loading screen on startup
- added code in nucleus to draw seven circles representing the paths
- added code to only allow the circles with at least one currently visible electron to be drawn
